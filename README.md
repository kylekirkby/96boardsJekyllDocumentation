# 96boards Jekyll Documentation
The 96boards website is built using Jekyll, a static website generator based on Ruby, which allows the site to be more responsive and increase the performance of the site.

# Running Jekyll
Jekyll uses Ruby to generate the static website so having Ruby installed is a must if you are
trying to build the 96boards site. Before you build the site use the following steps to make sure your environment is setup for a Jekyll build.
1. `$ ruby -v`
This will show you the current version of Ruby that you have installed on your machine. We are using the ruby version 2.4.0 (ruby 2.4.0p0 (2016-12-24 revision 57164) [x86_64-darwin16]). This version may well change in the future development of this site but you can always find the version being currently used in the [Gemfile](https://stash.git.linaro.org/projects/MAR/repos/96boards.org-static/browse/Gemfile)
2. `$ jekyll -v`
This command, once executed, will display the current version of Jekyll you have installed. We are using `jekyll 3.4.3` but this may change in the future so it may be useful to note that you can find the current version actively being used in the [Gemfile](https://stash.git.linaro.org/projects/MAR/repos/96boards.org-static/browse/Gemfile) under `gem "jekyll", "3.4.3"`.
